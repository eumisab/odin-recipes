      <li>Using the same pan with oil, fry beef by batches for about 3-5 minutes total. Cook until lightly browned then transfer beef in a plate and set aside.</li>
      <li>Pour-in remaining marinade to the same pan. Simmer over low heat for about 3 minutes stirring once. Return fried beef to the pan and gently stir to combine. Let it simmer for about 5 minutes or until sauce thickens.</li>
