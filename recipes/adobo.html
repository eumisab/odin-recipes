        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>Adobo or adobar (Spanish: marinade, sauce, or seasoning) is the immersion of raw food in a stock (or sauce) composed variously of paprika, oregano, salt, garlic, and vinegar to preserve and enhance its flavor. The Portuguese variant is known as Carne de vinha d'alhos.</p>
          <p>Adobo is a cooking technique, therefore it's also the name of a dish. As mentioned above, it's a traditional Philippine dish, usually Adobo Chicken or Adobo Pork. Adobo is prepared using pantry basics, like white vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, peppercorns, and bay leaves, to create a marinade.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs pork belly</li>
            <li>2/4 cup of Soy sauce</li>
            <li>Lemongrass</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of Vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of Peppercorn</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of Oyster sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of garlic</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of onions</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Chop your meat of choice into cubes or if you are having chicken, cut them into 8 equal pieces to make sure that they are all cooked evenly.</li>
            <li>Chop your garlic and dice your onions into tiny bits and pieces. This will help in sauteing later.</li>
            <li>You can use anything to cook this on. Ideally, you would want a vessel with high walls so that you have space for simmering the meat.</li>
            <li>Saute you're garlic until it is golden brown then add the onions in. The onions should be soft and a bit caramelized before adding the meat.</li>
            <li>When they are properly sauted, add your bay leaves, lemongrass, and meat or poultry in the pan to add some color to the meat before we begin simmering. Put the lid on while it is sauteing so that the juices of the meat will collect in the pan.</li>
            <li>When the meat has color, pour in the soy and oyster sauce. If you are cooking poultry, you can add in the vinegar too.</li>
            <li>If the sauce you added does not submerge all of your meat, add water.</li>
            <li>Simmer for 30-45 mins until it is tender to your liking.</li>
            <li>If you are cooking meat, you can add the vinegar now. After that, you can now turn up the heat and begin reducing your sauce to intensify it's flavors. Reduce until the sauce is thick.</li>
            <li>You're adobo is now ready to serve! This is best served with a side of plain or garlic rice.</li>
        </ol>
